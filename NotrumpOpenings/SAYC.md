2&clubs; is “non-forcing” Stayman, meaning that the bidding can stop in two of a suit.
Opener rebids 2&hearts; with 4–4 in the majors. If responder rebids three of either minor, he shows slam interest and at least a five-card suit.

The Jacoby transfer that shows a five-card suit is used for the majors: 2? is a
transfer to hearts, 2? is a transfer to spades. Opener accepts the transfer, though
he can jump to the three level with 17 points and four-card support for responder’s
major. For example:
   * 1NT — 2&diams;
      * 2&hearts; = normal acceptance of the transfer.
      * 3&hearts; = 17 points and four-card heart support.
If, after the transfer is accepted, responder bids a new suit, that is natural and
game forcing. Possible calls after the accepted transfer are:
   * 1NT — 2&hearts;
      * 2&spades; — Pass = content to play 2&spades;.
      * 2NT = invitational with 5 spades. Over 2NT opener may pass or bid 3?spades a minimum hand; bid 3NT or 4&spades; with a maximum.
      * 3&spades; = invitational with a six-card suit.
      * 3&clubs;, 3&diams;, 3&hearts; = natural and game forcing.
      * 3NT = asking for a choice between 3NT and 4&spades;.
      * 4&spades; = placing the contract, with a six-card or longer suit.

A 2&spades; response requires the 1NT bidder to rebid 3&clubs;, which may be passed with a club bust, or responder may rebid 3&diams; with a diamond bust. Example:
1NT — 2?
   * 3&clubs; — Pass = club bust
   * 3&diams; = diamond bust (notrump opener passes).

Other responses to 1NT:
1NT — 3♣, 3♦ = a six-card or longer suit and invitational to 3NT.
— 3♥, 3♠ = at least a six-card suit and slam interest (otherwise,
responder uses a transfer bid).
— 4♣ = Gerber, asking for aces. 4♣ IS GERBER OVER ANY 1NT OR 2NT
BY PARTNER, INCLUDING A REBID OF 1NT OR 2NT. Responses
show the number of aces, by steps, just as over a Blackwood
4NT. 5♣ is used to ask for kings.
Ace Asking King Asking
1NT — 4♣ 1NT — 4♣
4♦ = 0 or 4 aces 4x = 5♣
4♥ = 1 ace 5♦ = 0 or 4 kings
4♠ = 2 aces 5♥ = 1 king
4NT = 3 aces 5♠ = 2 kings
5NT = 3 kings
If the player using Gerber makes any bid other than 5♣, that is to play
(including 4NT).
A direct raise of 1NT to 4NT is natural and invites 6NT. 4NT is slam invitational only
because 4♣ is available as Gerber (to ask about aces).
