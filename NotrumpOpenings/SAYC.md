Notrump openings show a balanced hand. It is permissible to have a 5 card major suit provided the hand is otherwise suitable for notrump.

2♣ is “non-forcing” Stayman, meaning that the bidding can stop in two of a suit.
Opener rebids 2♥ with 4–4 in the majors. If responder rebids three of either minor,
he shows slam interest and at least a five-card suit.

The Jacoby transfer that shows a five-card suit is used for the majors: 2♦ is a
transfer to hearts, 2♥ is a transfer to spades. Opener accepts the transfer, though
he can jump to the three level with 17 points and four-card support for responder’s
major. For example:
1NT — 2♦
   * 2♥ = normal acceptance of the transfer.
   * 3♥ = 17 points and four-card heart support.

If, after the transfer is accepted, responder bids a new suit, that is natural and
game forcing. Possible calls after the accepted transfer are:
1NT — 2♥ — 2♠
   * Pass = content to play 2♠.
   * 2NT = invitational with a five-card suit. Opener may pass or bid 3♠
with a minimum hand; bid 3NT or 4♠ with a maximum.
   * 3♠ = invitational with a six-card suit. Opener may pass with a minimum hand; bid 3NT or 4♠ with a maximum.
   * 3♣, 3♦, 3♥ = natural and game forcing.
   * 3NT = asking for a choice between 3NT and 4♠.
   * 4♠ = placing the contract, with a six-card or longer suit.

A 2♠ response requires the 1NT bidder to rebid 3♣, which may be passed with a
club bust, or responder may rebid 3♦ with a diamond bust. Example:
1NT — 2♠ — 3♣ 
   * Pass = club bust
   * 3♦ = diamond bust (notrump opener passes).

Other responses to 1NT:
   * 3♣, 3♦ = a six-card or longer suit and invitational to 3NT.
   * 3♥, 3♠ = at least a six-card suit and slam interest (otherwise,
responder uses a transfer bid).
   * 4♣ = Gerber, asking for aces. (See Slam Bidding)
   * A direct raise of 1NT to 4NT is natural and invites 6NT. 4NT is slam invitational only because 4♣ is available as Gerber (to ask about aces).
