### Jacoby Transfer
The Jacoby transfer that shows a five-card suit is used for the majors: 2♦ is a
transfer to hearts, 2♥ is a transfer to spades. Opener accepts the transfer, though
he can jump to the three level with 17 points and four-card support for responder’s
major. For example:

1NT — 2♦

   * 2♥ = normal acceptance of the transfer.
   * 3♥ = 17 points and four-card heart support.

If, after the transfer is accepted, responder bids a new suit, that is natural and
game forcing. Possible calls after the accepted transfer are:

1NT — 2♥ — 2♠
   * Pass = content to play 2♠.
   * 2NT = invitational with a five-card suit. Opener may pass or bid 3♠
with a minimum hand; bid 3NT or 4♠ with a maximum.
   * 3♠ = invitational with a six-card suit. Opener may pass with a minimum hand; bid 3NT or 4♠ with a maximum.
   * 3♣, 3♦, 3♥ = natural and game forcing.
   * 3NT = asking for a choice between 3NT and 4♠.
   * 4♠ = placing the contract, with a six-card or longer suit.
