This contains a Markdown file that describes a bridge system, in this case [Standard American Yellow Card (SAYC)][http://www.acbl.org/documentlibrary/play/SP3%20(bk)%20single%20pages.pdf].
Fork this repository to create your own system notes.
Do not edit system.md directly. It is generated by executing generate.bat. (Eventually I will add a *NIX variant.)
If you have your own conventions or treatments, describe them in separate files then include them in the batch file.
