This branch contains a Markdown file "system.md" that describes a bridge system, 
in this case Standard American Yellow Card (SAYC) as described at 
http://www.acbl.org/documentlibrary/play/SP3%20(bk)%20single%20pages.pdf.

Rules for making changes:
   * No work is to be done in the Master branch directly. 
   * Make a branch (e.g., *my-md-updates*) to modify existing treatments or add new ones
      * Branch off of Master
      * Add or modify .md files
      * Issue a pull request if desired
      * Pull requests **must not** modify `README`, `gen.bat`, or `system.md`. 
   * Make a branch to describe your own system (e.g., *my-system*).
      * Branch off of an existing system that closely resembles your system so that your `gen.bat` is mostly complete.
      * Modify `gen.bat` by cherry-picking modules in existing .md files
      * Generate `system.md` by executing `gen.bat` in the Windows PowerShell. Do not edit it directly.
      * Merge changes from *my-md-updates* as needed. 
      * Periodically pull from Master to pick up improvements from others.
