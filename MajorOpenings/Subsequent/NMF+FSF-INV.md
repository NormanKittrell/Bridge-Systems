## Invitational New Minor Forcing and Fourth Suit Forcing
A new minor suit at the responder's second bid or later shows invitational or better values 
and is forcing for one round.
This also applies to minor suit openings.

1♥ - 1♠

1NT (or 2♣) - 2♦ (forcing)

In this case, opener is encouraged to show secondary support for responder's suit. 
When more than one minor is available, it tends to show a stopper for NT.

### Second Round Jumps
When treating New Minor Forcing and Fourth Suit Forcing as invitational, 
all second round jumps are forcing to game: 

1♥ - 1♠

1NT

   * 3♥ = game forcing (5-5 or 5-4)
   * 3♠ = game forcing (6+)
   
Compare to:

1♣ - 1♠

1NT

   * 2♦ = invitational (5 spades, could have 4 hearts)
   * 2♥ = signoff (5-5 or 5-4)
